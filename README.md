# Computational Modelling

MOst of the resources, code, and assignments for the "Computing in Sciences II" course, offered at IIIT-H, have been included.
It focuses on developing Python programming skills for scientific computing, analysis, and visualization through practical problem-solving.  
Other kinds of work, for example Biomolecular Structures's course's structure visualization report document, containing VMD visualizations of proteins, TK Console TCL code, and a question on using AlphaFold3 has been shown.

### Course Objectives
- Write small Python programs to solve problems in science and mathematics.
- Perform computations, analyses, and visualizations.
- Gain familiarity with Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and SymPy.
- Learn mathematical techniques used in scientific research.
- Protein visualization and Modelling
